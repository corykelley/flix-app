# Flix

Flix is a Netflix component clone. The simple interface asks for a movie and returns it's title, genre, year released, an overview, and poster image if one is available.

I styled this using the backdrop image provided from the api as the background image for the current movie. I felt this, along with a gradient overlay, would give it a modern feel similar to movie/tv streaming apps today.

## Future Enhancements

I'm quite happy with how v1 of the app looks and feels, especially since it was more of a prototype than anything else. I wanted to implement an autocomplete for the search box, but this proved to be challenging with the limitations of the api and the time I wanted to spend on this little project.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Tools

This app was made entirely in React and styled with SASS/CSS from scratch. All images come directly from the api itself and I do not own any of them. API: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
